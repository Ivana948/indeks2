            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Ivana Georgieva, and I am from the charming town of Kratovo. I am 20 years old, born on the 19th
                of March 2004, in Skopje. I have spent most of my life in Kratovo, where I completed my high school education at Kratovo.
                Currently, I am pursuing my studies at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, also known as FINKI, located in Skopje.</p>
            <p>I have a deep passion for animals, and my love for them has been a significant part of my life. In addition to this, I
                thoroughly enjoy watching TV series, movies, and listening to music, which provide me with endless entertainment and joy.
                Traveling is another one of my great passions.I find immense pleasure in exploring new places and immersing myself in the diverse cultures
                of different countries.</p>
            <p>Language is a key to understanding and connecting with people, and I am proud to be multilingual. I am fluent in Macedonian,
                English, French, and Spanish. This ability to communicate in multiple languages has enriched my travel experiences and has allowed
                me to form meaningful connections with individuals from various backgrounds.
            <p>I have a special place in my heart for my pets: Toby, my beloved cat, and Jessie, my faithful dog. Toby has been with me for 5 years, and Jessie
                joined our family 6 months ago. They bring immense joy and fellowship into my life, each with their unique personalities and charm.</p>

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>I love traveling because it allows me to break away from routine and immerse myself in new experiences. Each
                journey presents an opportunity to explore diverse cultures, taste different cuisines, and witness breathtaking landscapes.
                Traveling broadens my perspective, challenges my comfort zone, and teaches me invaluable lessons about adaptability and
                appreciation for the world's diversity. I have traveled extensively throughout Macedonia. Outside of my home country, I have
                visited Poland, Germany, Greece, Netherlands and Spain. I have a strong desire to explore many more countries and cities in the future.</p>
